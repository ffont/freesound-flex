SHORT-TIME TODO:
- Fix instant search issue than can provoke mismatched results and query specification if typing fast. One possible idea is to introduce a timestamp in the request and only display responses if they are returned in chronological order (that is to say, if we perform queries q1, q2 and q3 we expect responses r1, r2 and r3 in the same order. if r2 takes longer to compute than r3 in the server, we might obtain r1, r3 and r2, so the displayed results for q3 will be r2. a solution would be to never display r2 since we know that r3 corresponds to the last query)
- Create more examples and write documentation
